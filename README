##### KONECT Toolbox #####

This is a toolbox for the analysis of large complex networks written in
Matlab.  It is part of the KONECT project (Koblenz Network Collection)

http://konect.uni-koblenz.de/

This Toolbox implements individual network analysis functions,
statistics and some machine learning methods.  If you want a complete
"run all analyses on this network" package, use the KONECT Analysis
package:

https://github.com/kunegis/konect-analysis

The toolbox largely implements the graph analysis functions described in 
the KONECT Handbook:

In particular, the KONECT Handbook contains all formal definitions of
the computations performed in this toolbox. 

## Installation ##

The toolbox consists entirely of *.m files.  To use it, add the
directory m/ to the Matlab path, e.g., using addpath().  

## Requirements ##

Some functions need BGL, the Boost Graph Library. 

Installation of BGL:
* Download version 4.0.1 from website (newer versions may not work)
* unzip it
* (on some systems:  install libstdc++5 from http://packages.debian.org/stable/base/libstdc++5)
* symlink the unzipped matlab_bgl to here
