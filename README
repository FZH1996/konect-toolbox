== KONECT Toolbox ==

This is a toolbox for the analysis of large complex networks written in
Matlab, but also largely compatible with GNU Octave.  It is part of the
KONECT project by Jérôme Kunegis at the University of Namur, Belgium,
with web hosting provided by the Institute for Web Science and
Technologies (WeST) at the University of Koblenz-Landau, Germany.

This toolbox implements individual network analysis functions,
statistics and some machine learning methods.  If you want a complete
"run all analyses on this network" package, use the KONECT Analysis
package:

This toolbox largely implements the graph analysis functions described in 
the KONECT Handbook: 

https://github.com/kunegis/konect-handbook/blob/master/konect-handbook.pdf

In particular, the KONECT Handbook contains all formal definitions of
the computations performed in this toolbox.

=== Installation ===

The toolbox consists entirely of *.m files.  To use it, add the
directory m/ to the Matlab path, e.g., using addpath() or by setting the
$MATLABPATH variable.

GNU Octave too supports the addpath() function and $MATLABPATH
variable. 

=== Requirements ===

Some functions need BGL, the Boost Graph Library.  

Installation of BGL:
* Download version 4.0.1 from website (newer versions may not work)
* unzip it
* (on some systems:  install libstdc++5 from http://packages.debian.org/stable/base/libstdc++5)
* symlink the unzipped matlab_bgl to here

=== Usage ===

The toolbox consists of individual functions, each of which is
containing in its own *.m file in the m/ directory.  

Most functions are self-contained, and can be used as-is. 

Each function is documented in its source file.  

The source files contain UTF-8 encoded text in the comments; the rest is
ASCII.  

The functions are used from both Matlab and GNU Octave.  Since none of
these is properly standardised, we can't assure that all versions will
work -- when in doubt, ask. 

If you fix bugs or add new features, please contact Jérôme Kunegis
<jerome.kunegis@unamur.be> so we can merge your changes into the master
version.
