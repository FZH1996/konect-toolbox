% The [lines] statistic in KONECT is not a mathemathical meaningful
% measure, but instead refers to a trivial way to assess the "size" of a
% network.  It equals the number of lines in the dataset file.  It
% cannot be computed in Matlab (hence this empty file).  This file must
% exist to declare to KONECT that the statistic exists, and to declare
% its group (the absence of a "GROUP:" declaration here means that the
% statistic applies to all networks.)
